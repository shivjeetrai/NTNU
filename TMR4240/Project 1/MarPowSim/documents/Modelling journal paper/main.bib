abstract = {This paper gives an overview of engine systems modelling by first and second law analysis. Complex engine systems are becoming more commonly implemented to meet the increasing demands of fuel efficiency and emission legislation. Future engine systems may also include both exhaust gas treatment and fuel processing devices. This leads to complex interactions within the thermodynamics and chemistry of powerplant systems. There is therefore a need to improve the systems modelling methods. This concerns first of all the composition tracking and the models of three-way catalytic exhaust converters and fuel processors. The applicability of gas dynamics modelling to chemically complex systems is also discussed. All these processes need to be modelled as interacting parts of one system.},

abstract = {A new calculation model, able to predict the engine performance during an engine transient, has been developed, based on an existing wave action code. Previously to the model development, the turbocharged diesel engine's transient phenomena (turbocharger lag, thermal transient and energy transport delay) were deeply analysed on the basis of experimental information. The study has been focused on the load transient, i.e. torque increase from idle, at constant engine speed of a high speed direct injection (DI) turbocharged engine. Experimental load transient tests have been performed, with the aim of obtaining a combustion database during engine transient operation, to input into a combustion simulation submodel. The applied methodology allows the characterization of the transient combustion process in any DI turbocharged engine.},
