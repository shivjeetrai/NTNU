abstract = {This paper gives an overview of engine systems modelling by first and second law analysis. Complex engine systems are becoming more commonly implemented to meet the increasing demands of fuel efficiency and emission legislation. Future engine systems may also include both exhaust gas treatment and fuel processing devices. This leads to complex interactions within the thermodynamics and chemistry of powerplant systems. There is therefore a need to improve the systems modelling methods. This concerns first of all the composition tracking and the models of three-way catalytic exhaust converters and fuel processors. The applicability of gas dynamics modelling to chemically complex systems is also discussed. All these processes need to be modelled as interacting parts of one system.},
